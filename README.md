## How do I publish a theme?

Make a pull request adding your theme in a folder. In the folder, create a README.md file with the following format:

Theme Name: Theme name here

Dashactyl Version: Dashactyl Version (Example: v2)

Theme Language: Language here (Example: English)

Then someone will test and review the theme, then merge the pull request.
